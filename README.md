# Skill Issue Study Tool Game

Skill Issue is a 2D study tool game for educational and entertainment purposes. The basis of this game is that the
player will gradually get better at their study material the more they engage in the game. This project will also
include E-Commerce aspects, like an in-game shop for players to enteract with and buy things that allow them
to engage further. Another part will be a subscription for players that want more functionality and personalization.
The main source of potential revenue will be Advertisement Panels and Subscriptions. The main idea of this project is to allow the user to enjoy
learning and having fun at the same time. 

Includes:
- Functions for gameplay and menus
- Scripts for game logic, authentication, database and connections

## Status
11/24/25 - As of today we have a prototype for the questions, menu, in-game shop, mock ads, as well as the connections with Firebase which stores 
data of the user as well as user information(Email and Password). 

## Remaining Work
11/24/25 - As of todays prototype, we still have a good bit of polishing to do. We need to continue to fix any remaining bugs and make the game "unbreakable". We also still need to integrate a mock subscription system to remove ads for the user. By the end of the deadline, we hope to have something that is polished and up to date with what is required. 

## Challenges
11/24/25 - So far, the hardest part of this project collectively, is the knowledge gap with learning JavaScript. I am thankful for the adversity because it will allow us to 
be more knowledgable about it from here on out. One of the hardest parts of the project itself was integrating the database to connect properly with the game data as well as user
emails and passwords. It was much easier on us to use Firebase for this because it uses cloud services to store it for us, but it was still difficult to make sure all the links were
in the right place to recieve the data to Firebase.
