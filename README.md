# Skill Issue Study Tool Video Game

Skill Issue is a 2D study tool game for educational and entertainment purposes. The basis of this game is that the
player will gradually get better at their study material the more they engage in the game. This project will also
include E-Commerce aspects, like an in-game shop for players to enteract with and buy things that allow them
to engage further. Another part will be a subscription for players that want more functionality and personalization.
The main source of revenue will be Advertisement Panels and Subscriptions. Maybe eventually encorporate things like "One time purchases"
where players can get things to enhance learning and enjoyment inside their individual games.

Includes:
- Functions for gameplay and menus
- Scripts for game logic and connecting function
